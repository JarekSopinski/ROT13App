# ROT13App

This app lets you code and decode words using [ROT13 cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13). It's based on a script which I've written for an exercise from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/caesars-cipher). 

If you're interested how the script works, you can read the full description [here](https://github.com/JarekSopinski/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/BasicAlgorithmScripting/16_Ceasars_Cipher_2nd_solution.js).
